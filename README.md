test.py does the following:

grab all matches on-site for a given league (specified in the script) and write that to events.pickle. 

loop over matches and grab all "Popular" markets and write that to markets.pickle.

within each market, write all selections to selections.pickle.

The console will print a summary of the events/markets/selections.
